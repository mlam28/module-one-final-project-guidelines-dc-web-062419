#### Simple Tamagotchi Pets Quiz Game
This project was made as part of our journey to becoming developers.  It is the first project we have worked on together, and the first project for us as individuals.  This simple Tamagotchi Pets Quiz Game is made entirely with Ruby and RubyGems.  Hopefully, it will bring joy to some, and frustration to others. The app is a simple command line application, where the user creates a virtual pet and attempts to keep it happy while playing quiz games to achieve higher levels. There are five total levels, and each level corresponds to a new skill that your virtual "pet" can theoreticaly perform. If the pet reaches a hunger and happiness level of zero, then it "dies", or erases itself from the database, and the user is forced to start over with a new pet. 

This program relies heavily on the use of ActiveRecord associations which tested our understanding of databases and Object-Oriented Ruby.

#### Prerequisites
This program utilizes the following Ruby Gems included in the Gemfile. To play, open up terminal and navigate to these game files. Please run "bundle install" to download all gems associated with running this program, "rake db:migrate" to create the databases, and "rake db:seed" to migrate the necessary information needed for this program to run smoothly. 

Steps:
In terminal, run: 1. "bundle install"
                  2. "rake db:migrate"
                  3. "rake db:seed"
